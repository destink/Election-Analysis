## Audit Summary 

The script utilized for the election analysis could be expanded upon to analyze a larger scope of counties or even states by analyzing a larger data set with more candidates and districts or by modifying the code to capture voting demographics such as income, age, or any other descriptor that the election commission thought would be benificial to capture. The script could also be modified to deteremine the method of vote that the voters used such as "mail-in ballot" or "in-person" to determine which counties utilize which methods the most in order to focus the next marketing campaign incorporating that information.
